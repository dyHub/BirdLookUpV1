# Image-Recognizer-iPhone-

This is an iPhone app in which you can take a picture of anything, and using the CamFind APi, it will return the string of what the
object is! This is meant to be as a starting point for a Bird Recognizer app, in which we use the description returned from CamFind to do 
a Google Image API search.

Enjoy!
